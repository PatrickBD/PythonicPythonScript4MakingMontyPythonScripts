# PythonicPythonScript4MakingMontyPythonScripts

(I know, It is pretty much the best title ever!)

The python language was named after Monty Python's Flying Circus so why not use python to generate an unlimited supply of new Monty Python scripts? This notebook is a compressed version of my text generating AI. Text generator like this one require a lot of computational power so it only became really feasible to do them on Kaggle Kernels when they upgraded to have a GPU and a 6 hour computational limit. Even so, 6 hours is still kind of lean for an LSTM text generator but I can make it work quite well anyways. 

The goal of this notebook is to serve as a introduction to text generation NLPs. These LSTM text generator are actually not that difficult to make. However, most tutorials on the topic are incomplete and/or generate poor results. I'll try to talk about every step of the process thoroughly and clearly. Other than that, this notebook is pretty easy to adapt to any text generation you might want to do. Just pop in any sizeable txt file and the model will learn to make more text in that style. Things like Shakespeare are common and work well for this type of text generation. Make sure that GPU is enabled in settings. Now lets make an AI generate something completely different.
