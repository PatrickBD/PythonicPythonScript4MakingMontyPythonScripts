      "source": "# Making New AI Generated Star Wars Scripts\n(This notebook is a fork of my much better named \"Pythonic Python Script for Making Monty Python Scripts\" kernal. I wanted to work with the Star Wars scripts for another code project so I'll start with the preprocessing work and use it here as well. After the Preprocessing section, this notebook is mostly the same. Check it out here: https://www.kaggle.com/valkling/pythonicpythonscript4makingmontypythonscripts)\n\nThis notebook is a compressed version of my text generating AI. Text generator like this one require a lot of computational power so it only became really feasible to do them on Kaggle Kernels when they upgraded to have a GPU and a 6 hour computational limit. Even so, 6 hours is still kind of lean for an LSTM text generator but we can make it work quite well anyways.\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to serve as a introduction to text generation NLPs. These LSTM text generator are actually not that difficult to make. However, most tutorials on the topic are incomplete and/or generate poor results. I'll try to talk about every step of the process thoroughly and clearly. Other than that, this notebook is pretty easy to adapt to any text generation you might want to do. Just pop in any sizeable txt file and the model will learn to make more text in that style. Things like Shakespeare are common and work well for this type of text generation. Make sure that GPU is enabled in settings. Now lets make an AI generate something completely different.\n\n## Imports\nAs always, a block of imports.\n"

However, usually if gotten to roughly around 1.0 loss the generator is good enough for decent outputs. Can train almost indefinitely on most models. We are not *really* worried about overfitting. Hypothetically, if the loss gets too low the text might become overfit, which in this case means just copying the text in the most inefficient way possible. However, it should take an unrealistically long time to get to that point (or just impossible).\n\nSince the Star Wars scripts are so much smaller (around 1/6th) than the size of Monty Python's scripts, lets lower the batch size and set the total epochs much higher to make full use of the 6 hour time limit.\n"

It takes a random seed pattern from the training set, predicts the next character, adds it to the end of the pattern, then drops the first character of the pattern and predicts on the new pattern and so forth.\n\nPretty much this text generator *tries* to accurately duplicate the Star Wars script but inevitably makes errors ,and those errors compound, but is still trained well enough that it ends up making Star Wars *like* scripts. We could actually interperate these prediction errors as as a form of creativity on the part of the computer, with loss values equating to the level of abstraction from the original.\n\n## The Loopbreaker\nThis is simple bit of I came up with while putting this together. Every so many character predictions, the program just changes one of the characters in the pattern to predict on (except the last few, to prevent spelling errors). This causes our model to perceive a slightly different text which causes it to change it's overall predictions slightly too. Without this, even a well trained model might start to repeat itself at some point and get caught in a loop. The loopbreaker can even prevent overfitting or allow under trained models to perform much better. Without a loopbreaker like this, models will need to be trained for many more hours before they can function without looping in on themselves.\n\nChanging this value up and down an interesting way to significantly change the output. Setting it high will have more repeated speech, slightly lower might get many line starting the same then vering off into different directions, really low will get lots of varied text but line structures and format might become unstable.

More AI structures are needed to keep track of the plot and such. Anyways, this is the extent of most AI text generation these days.
